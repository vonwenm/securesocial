		- Removed servceInfo from OAuth1Info. That object can be retrieved from SecureSocial.serviceInfoFor method now.
		- Backward incompatible changes to the Java API: deleted AuthenticationMethod, OAuth1Info, OAuth2Info, PasswordInfo, SocialUser and UserId. This was required because after introducing the Identity trait I need to make sure the user gets its own object in the actions instead of a SocialUser instance.
